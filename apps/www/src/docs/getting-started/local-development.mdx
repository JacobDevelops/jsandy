summary: Local development with JStack

# Quickstart

Start the Next.js dev server by running:

```bash Terminal
npm run dev
```

This command will start your Next.js application at `http://localhost:3000`. This is all you need to do if you plan to deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or similar.

## Cloudflare Worker Setup

If you are using JStack to develop for Cloudflare Workers, launch two terminal windows to run the frontend and backend separately:

```bash Terminal
# Terminal 1: Frontend
npm run dev     # Available on http://localhost:3000

# Terminal 2: Backend
wrangler dev    # Available on http://localhost:8080
```

These commands will start your:

- Frontend on `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend on `http://localhost:8080`

To let your frontend know about your backend on a separate port, adjust your client:

```ts lib/client.ts {5-6}
import type { AppRouter } from "@/server"
import { createClient } from "jstack"

export const client = createClient<AppRouter>({
  // ðŸ‘‡ Add our port 8080 cloudflare URL
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:8080/api",
})
```

**How it works**

- Your frontend runs as a standard Next.js application
- Your backend runs in Wrangler, Cloudflare's development environment
- API requests from your frontend are automatically routed to the correct backend URL
