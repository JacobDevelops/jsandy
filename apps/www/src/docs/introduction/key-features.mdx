# Key Features

## 1. Ultra fast & Lightweight

Built on top of Hono's lightweight [RegExpRouter](https://hono.dev/docs/concepts/routers#regexprouter) and [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/), which, unlike Prisma, does not ship a massive query engine, JStack is fast. With a single click, you can deploy your Next.js server to globally distributed Cloudflare workers for maximum performance.

You can follow the Vercel pattern (coming soon) to get the same performance on Vercel, Netlify, Railway and other deployment platforms.

## 2. End-to-end Type-Safe

Type-safety is my favorite part about the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/). The difference in JStack is that its client is not coupled to React Query hooks. In JStack you get a simple TypeScript client that you can use with any state manager you want:

```tsx app/page.tsx
const res = await client.post.recent.$get()
const post = await res.json()
// ^ automatically type-safe: { post: Post }
```

Learn how to set up your lightweight, type-safe client in our [first steps](/docs/getting-started/first-steps).

## 3. Highly Cost Effective

If you follow the _"intended way"_ of deploying Next.js, you'll deploy your app to Vercel, Netlify, or similar and call it a day. With JStack, you can deploy your backend to Cloudflare Workers (or any other platform) with a single click, completely separate from your frontend.

Cloudflare Workers are also one of the **cheapest** (100K requests per day for free, no credit card required) and **fastest** ways to run your serverless code.

```bash Terminal
npx wrangler deploy server/index.ts
```

I have run entire software projects on Cloudflare's free plan, such as [profanity.dev](https://profanity.dev). I think Cloudflare Workers is the most underrated computing platform in 2025 (this is not sponsored in _any_ way).
