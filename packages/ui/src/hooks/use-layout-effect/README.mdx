# useLayoutEffect Hook

The `useLayoutEffect` hook is a custom implementation that provides a safe way to use React's `useLayoutEffect` in both client-side and server-side rendering environments. It addresses the warning that React emits when calling `useLayoutEffect` on the server by replacing it with a no-op function in server-side contexts.

## Features

- Provides a consistent API for `useLayoutEffect` across client and server environments
- Suppresses React warnings during server-side rendering
- Behaves identically to React's native `useLayoutEffect` in browser environments
- Zero-cost abstraction in client-side rendering

## Installation

```bash
npm install @jsandy/ui
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { useLayoutEffect } from '@jsandy/ui/use-layout-effect';

function MyComponent() {
  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    // This effect will run synchronously after all DOM mutations
    // It's safe to use in both client and server environments
  }, []);

  return <div>My Component</div>;
}
```

## API

```typescript
const useLayoutEffect: typeof React.useLayoutEffect;
```

The API is identical to React's built-in `useLayoutEffect` hook.

### Parameters

- `effect`: A function that contains imperative, possibly effectful code.
- `deps` (optional): An array of dependencies. If present, the effect will only rerun when one of these dependencies changes.

## Examples

### Measuring DOM nodes

```tsx
import { useLayoutEffect } from '@jsandy/ui/use-layout-effect';
import { useState, useRef } from 'react';

function MeasureExample() {
  const [height, setHeight] = useState(0);
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    if (ref.current) {
      setHeight(ref.current.getBoundingClientRect().height);
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <div ref={ref}>
        <p>This div's height will be measured</p>
      </div>
      <p>The above div is {Math.round(height)}px tall</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Synchronizing with external libraries

```tsx
import { useLayoutEffect } from '@jsandy/ui/use-layout-effect';
import { useRef } from 'react';
import SomeExternalLibrary from 'some-external-library';

function ExternalLibraryComponent() {
  const elementRef = useRef(null);

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    if (elementRef.current) {
      const instance = new SomeExternalLibrary(elementRef.current);
      return () => {
        instance.destroy();
      };
    }
  }, []);

  return <div ref={elementRef}>External Library Container</div>;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Use `useLayoutEffect` when you need to perform DOM measurements or updates that should be synchronized with the browser's paint cycle.
2. Prefer `useEffect` for most side effects, unless you specifically need the synchronous behavior of `useLayoutEffect`.
3. Keep the logic inside `useLayoutEffect` as minimal as possible to avoid blocking visual updates.
4. Always provide a cleanup function if your effect creates subscriptions or allocates resources.

## Caveats

- While this implementation suppresses the warning on the server, remember that the effect still won't run in a server-side environment. Ensure your component can render correctly without relying on the effect for its initial state.
- Using `useLayoutEffect` can impact performance if the effect takes a long time to complete, as it blocks the browser from updating the screen.
- This implementation uses `globalThis?.document` to detect the environment. Ensure your bundler and runtime support this syntax.

## Implementation Details

The custom `useLayoutEffect` hook checks for the presence of `document` in the global scope to determine if it's running in a browser environment:

```javascript
const useLayoutEffect = Boolean(globalThis?.document) ? React.useLayoutEffect : () => {};
```

In a browser environment, it uses React's native `useLayoutEffect`. In a server-side environment (where `document` is not defined), it replaces `useLayoutEffect` with an empty function, effectively making it a no-op.

This approach allows you to use `useLayoutEffect` in your components without worrying about server-side rendering warnings or errors, while still maintaining the expected behavior in the browser.

By using this custom `useLayoutEffect` hook, you can write components that work seamlessly in both client-side and server-side rendering contexts, improving the overall reliability and consistency of your React applications.
