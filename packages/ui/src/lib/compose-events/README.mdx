# Compose Event Handlers Utility

The Compose Event Handlers Utility provides a function to combine multiple event handlers into a single function. This is particularly useful when working with React components where you need to attach your own event handlers while preserving any existing ones.

## Key Features

1. Combines two event handlers into a single function
2. Optionally checks if the event's default action was prevented
3. Preserves the execution order of event handlers

## Main Function: composeEventHandlers

Composes two event handlers into a single function.

Usage:

```typescript
import { composeEventHandlers } from '@jsandy/ui/compose-event-handlers';

const originalHandler = (event) => {
  console.log('Original handler');
};

const ourHandler = (event) => {
  console.log('Our handler');
};

const composedHandler = composeEventHandlers(originalHandler, ourHandler);

// Use the composed handler
<button onClick={composedHandler}>Click me</button>;
```

### Parameters

- `originalEventHandler`: The original event handler (optional).
- `ourEventHandler`: Our custom event handler (optional).
- `options`: Configuration options (optional).
  - `checkForDefaultPrevented`: Whether to check if the event's default action was prevented before calling our handler (default: true).

### Return Value

Returns a function that calls both event handlers in order, respecting the `checkForDefaultPrevented` option.

## Use Cases

- Enhancing existing components with additional event handling logic
- Implementing higher-order components that need to preserve existing event handlers
- Creating reusable event handling logic that can be composed with other handlers

## Behavior

1. The original event handler is always called first.
2. If `checkForDefaultPrevented` is true (default):
   - Our event handler is only called if the event's default action was not prevented.
3. If `checkForDefaultPrevented` is false:
   - Our event handler is always called, regardless of whether the event's default action was prevented.

## Performance Considerations

- The utility creates a new function for each composition, which is generally not a performance concern but should be considered in high-frequency rendering scenarios.
- The check for `defaultPrevented` adds a small overhead but can prevent unnecessary executions of the second handler.

By using this Compose Event Handlers Utility, you can easily combine and manage multiple event handlers in your React components, improving code organization and reusability.
