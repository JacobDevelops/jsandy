# Compose Refs Utility

The Compose Refs Utility provides functions to work with and combine multiple React refs. This is particularly useful when you need to apply multiple refs to a single element, which is a common scenario when building reusable components or working with libraries that require refs.

## Key Features

1. Set a ref to a given value, handling different ref types
2. Compose multiple refs into a single ref callback
3. Custom hook for composing refs with proper memoization

## Main Functions and Hook

### setRef

Sets a given ref to a given value, handling both callback refs and RefObject(s).

### composeRefs

Composes multiple refs into a single ref callback.

Usage:

```jsx
import { composeRefs } from './compose-refs';

function MyComponent({ forwardedRef }) {
  const internalRef = useRef(null);
  const composedRef = composeRefs(internalRef, forwardedRef);

  return <div ref={composedRef}>Content</div>;
}
```

### useComposedRefs

A custom hook that composes multiple refs with proper memoization.

Usage:

```jsx
import { useComposedRefs } from '@jsandy/ui/compose-refs';

function MyComponent({ forwardedRef }) {
  const internalRef = useRef(null);
  const composedRef = useComposedRefs(internalRef, forwardedRef);

  return <div ref={composedRef}>Content</div>;
}
```

## Use Cases

- Forwarding refs while also using them internally in a component
- Combining refs from multiple hooks or components
- Working with libraries that require refs while maintaining your own ref

## Performance Considerations

- The `useComposedRefs` hook uses `useCallback` to memoize the composed ref callback, preventing unnecessary re-renders
- `composeRefs` efficiently handles multiple ref types, including callback refs and RefObject(s)

By using this Compose Refs Utility, you can easily manage multiple refs in your React components, improving code reusability and compatibility with various ref-based APIs and libraries.
