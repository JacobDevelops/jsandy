# Rect Utility

The Rect Utility is a lightweight module designed to observe changes in an element's position and size on the screen. It provides a simple API to track elements and execute callbacks when their bounding rectangles change.

## Key Features

- Efficiently observe multiple elements simultaneously
- Automatically starts and stops the observation loop based on observed elements
- Provides a clean API for adding and removing observers

## Main Function: observeElementRect

The core of this utility is the `observeElementRect` function. It allows you to observe changes in an element's bounding rectangle and react to those changes.

### Usage

```typescript
import { observeElementRect, Measurable } from '@jsandy/ui/rect';

const element: Measurable = document.getElementById('my-element');

const stopObserving = observeElementRect(element, (rect) => {
  console.log('Element rect changed:', rect);
  // Perform actions based on the new rect
});

// Later, when you want to stop observing:
stopObserving();
```

### Parameters

- `elementToObserve`: The element to observe. It must implement the `Measurable` interface, which requires a `getBoundingClientRect()` method.
- `callback`: A function that will be called whenever the observed element's rectangle changes. It receives the new `DOMRect` as its argument.

### Return Value

The function returns a cleanup function. When called, it stops observing the element and removes the callback.

## How It Works

1. The utility maintains an internal map of observed elements and their callbacks.
2. It uses `requestAnimationFrame` to efficiently check for changes in element rectangles.
3. When changes are detected, it calls the registered callbacks with the new rectangle information.
4. The observation loop automatically starts when the first element is observed and stops when the last element is no longer being observed.

## Performance Considerations

- The utility is designed to minimize DOM reads and writes by batching operations.
- It only triggers callbacks for elements whose rectangles have actually changed.
- The internal loop automatically stops when no elements are being observed, preventing unnecessary work.

## Use Cases

- Tracking the position of floating elements (tooltips, popovers, etc.)
- Implementing scroll-based animations or effects
- Building custom layout systems that need to react to element size changes
- Creating responsive components that adapt to their container's size

By using this Rect Utility, you can easily track and respond to changes in element positioning and sizing, enabling more dynamic and responsive user interfaces in your applications.
