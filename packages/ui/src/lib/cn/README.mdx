# CN (Class Names) Utility

The CN (Class Names) Utility is a simple yet powerful function for combining and merging class names in React applications, with special handling for Tailwind CSS classes. It leverages the `clsx` library for class name combination and `tailwind-merge` for optimizing Tailwind CSS classes.

## Key Features

1. Combines multiple class names or class objects
2. Merges Tailwind CSS classes efficiently
3. Handles conditional classes seamlessly

## Main Function: cn

Combines and merges class names, optimizing for Tailwind CSS.

Usage:

```typescript
import { cn } from '@jsandy/ui/cn';

function MyComponent({ isActive, className }) {
  return (
    <div
      className={cn('base-class', isActive && 'active-class', className, {
        'conditional-class': someCondition,
      })}
    >
      Content
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Parameters

- `...inputs`: Any number of class names, objects, or arrays to be combined and merged.

### Return Value

Returns a string of merged class names, optimized for Tailwind CSS.

## Use Cases

- Combining static and dynamic classes in React components
- Merging prop-based classes with component-specific classes
- Handling conditional classes based on component state or props
- Optimizing Tailwind CSS classes to prevent conflicts and duplication

## How It Works

1. The `cn` function first uses `clsx` to combine all input classes. This handles:

   - Strings of class names
   - Objects where keys are class names and values are booleans
   - Arrays of class names
   - Nested combinations of the above

2. The result from `clsx` is then passed through `twMerge`, which:
   - Removes duplicate Tailwind CSS classes
   - Resolves conflicts between Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `text-red-500` and `text-blue-500`)
   - Merges related Tailwind CSS classes efficiently

## Performance Considerations

- The `cn` function is designed to be lightweight and efficient
- It optimizes Tailwind CSS classes, potentially reducing the overall size of your class strings
- For extremely performance-critical applications, consider memoizing the result if inputs are stable

By using this CN Utility, you can easily manage complex combinations of class names in your React components, with built-in optimization for Tailwind CSS classes. This leads to cleaner, more maintainable code and improved performance in your Tailwind CSS-based projects.
