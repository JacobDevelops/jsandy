# Label Component

## Overview

The Label component is a flexible and accessible way to create labels for form inputs in React applications. It provides consistent styling and behavior while allowing for easy customization to fit various use cases.

## Features

- Consistent styling with other form components
- Customizable appearance through className prop
- Proper semantic HTML using the <label /> element
- Supports all standard label attributes
- Prevents text selection on double-click
- Supports disabled state styling for associated form elements

## Installation

To use the Label component, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed in your project:

```
npm install @jsandy/ui
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the Label component:

```jsx
import { Label } from '@jsandy/ui/label';

function MyForm() {
  return (
    <form>
      <Label htmlFor="username">Username</Label>
      <input id="username" type="text" />
    </form>
  );
}
```

## Props

The Label component accepts all standard HTML label attributes. Some commonly used props include:

- `htmlFor`: The ID of the form control this label is associated with
- `className`: Additional CSS classes to apply to the label
- `children`: The content of the label (typically text)

## Customization

The Label component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling. You can further customize its appearance by:

1. Passing additional classes via the `className` prop.
2. Modifying the `labelVariants` configuration in the component file.
3. Extending the Tailwind CSS configuration in your project.

## Accessibility

The Label component is designed with accessibility in mind:

- It uses the semantic <label /> element for proper screen reader support.
- It prevents text selection on double-click, which can improve usability.
- It supports styling for disabled form elements.

When using this component, consider the following:

- Always associate labels with their corresponding form inputs using the 'htmlFor' attribute.
- Use clear and concise text for labels to improve form usability.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast between the label text and background.

## Examples

1. Basic label:

```jsx
<Label htmlFor="email">Email Address</Label>
```

2. Label with custom styling:

```jsx
<Label htmlFor="password" className="text-red-500">
  Password (required)
</Label>
```

3. Label with a disabled form element:

```jsx
<>
  <Label htmlFor="disabled-input">Disabled Input</Label>
  <input id="disabled-input" disabled />
</>
```

## Best Practices

- Use labels consistently across your application for a cohesive user experience.
- Consider the visual hierarchy of your form when styling labels.
- Group related form elements and labels together for better organization.
- Use the 'htmlFor' attribute to explicitly associate labels with their inputs, especially when the input is not a direct child of the label.
