- Smooth animation for opening and closing
- Overlay background for focus
- Accessible close button
- Customizable content, title, and description components
- Built on top of the Dialog component for accessibility

## Installation

To use the Sheet component, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed in your project:

```bash
npm install @jsandy/ui
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the Sheet component:

```jsx
import {
  Sheet,
  SheetTrigger,
  SheetContent,
  SheetHeader,
  SheetTitle,
  SheetDescription,
  SheetFooter,
  SheetClose,
} from '@jsandy/ui/sheet';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Sheet>
      <SheetTrigger>Open Sheet</SheetTrigger>
      <SheetContent>
        <SheetHeader>
          <SheetTitle>Sheet Title</SheetTitle>
          <SheetDescription>This is a description of the sheet content.</SheetDescription>
        </SheetHeader>
        <div>Your sheet content goes here</div>
        <SheetFooter>
          <SheetClose>Close</SheetClose>
        </SheetFooter>

## Accessibility

The Sheet component is built on top of the Dialog component, ensuring good accessibility practices:

- It uses appropriate ARIA roles and attributes.
- The close button is properly labeled for screen readers.
- Focus is managed when the sheet opens and closes.

## Customization

All components accept a `className` prop for custom styling. They use Tailwind CSS classes by default, which can be overridden or extended.

## Best Practices

1. Use sheets for secondary content that doesn't need to be always visible.
2. Ensure the sheet content is focused and easily dismissible.
3. Consider the impact on mobile devices and ensure responsive design.
4. Use appropriate positioning based on the context and content type.
5. Implement proper focus management for accessibility.
6. Keep content concise and relevant to avoid overwhelming the user.
