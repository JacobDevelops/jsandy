# VisuallyHidden Component

The VisuallyHidden component is a utility component that allows content to be hidden visually while remaining accessible to screen readers. This is useful for providing additional context to screen reader users without affecting the visual layout of the page.

## Features

- Hides content visually while keeping it accessible to screen readers
- Implements best practices for visually hidden content
- Customizable with additional styles and props

## Usage

```jsx
import { VisuallyHidden } from '@jsandy/ui/visually-hidden';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <button>
      <VisuallyHidden>Click here to</VisuallyHidden>
      Submit
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Props

The VisuallyHidden component accepts all props that a standard HTML `span` element can receive, including:

- `children`: React.ReactNode

- The content to be visually hidden

- `style`: React.CSSProperties (optional)

- Additional styles to be applied to the component

- `className`: string (optional)

- Additional CSS classes to apply to the component

## Examples

1. Basic Usage:

```javascriptreact
<VisuallyHidden>This text is only visible to screen readers</VisuallyHidden>
```

2. With a Button:

```javascriptreact
<button>
  <VisuallyHidden>Click here to</VisuallyHidden>
  Open Menu
</button>
```

3. With Custom Styles:

```javascriptreact
<VisuallyHidden style={{ color: 'red' }}>
  This text is red, but still visually hidden
</VisuallyHidden>
```

## Accessibility

The VisuallyHidden component uses a set of CSS properties that hide the content visually while keeping it accessible to screen readers. This technique is based on the approach used by Bootstrap and other major frameworks to ensure maximum compatibility and accessibility.

## Implementation Details

The component uses the following CSS properties to achieve the visually hidden effect:

- `position: absolute;`: Takes the element out of the normal document flow
- `border: 0;`: Removes any border
- `width: 1px; height: 1px;`: Makes the element as small as possible
- `padding: 0;`: Removes padding
- `margin: -1px;`: Ensures the element doesn't take up space
- `overflow: hidden;`: Hides any overflowing content
- `clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);`: Clips the content to a 0x0 rectangle
- `whiteSpace: nowrap;`: Prevents text wrapping
- `wordWrap: normal;`: Ensures normal word wrapping behavior

These properties ensure that the content is effectively hidden from sighted users while remaining in the DOM and accessible to screen readers.

## Best Practices

- Use VisuallyHidden for content that provides important context or instructions for screen reader users but is not necessary for sighted users.
- Avoid using VisuallyHidden for large blocks of text. It's best used for short, concise pieces of information.
- Ensure that the visually hidden content makes sense in the context of the surrounding visible content.

By using the VisuallyHidden component, you can enhance the accessibility of your application without affecting its visual design.
