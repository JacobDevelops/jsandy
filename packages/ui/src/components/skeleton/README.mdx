# Skeleton Component

## Overview

The Skeleton component is a versatile UI element designed to display a placeholder while content is loading. It provides a visual representation that mimics the shape and structure of the content being loaded, improving perceived performance and creating a smoother user experience during content loading.

## Features

- Animated pulse effect to indicate loading state
- Customizable appearance through className prop
- Adapts to the size of its container
- Can be used for various content types (text, images, buttons, etc.)

## Installation

To use the Skeleton component, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed in your project:

```bash
npm install @jsandy/ui
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the Skeleton component:

```jsx
import { Skeleton } from '@jsandy/ui/skeleton';

function LoadingCard() {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <Skeleton className="h-32 w-full" /> {/* Image placeholder */}
      <div className="card-content">
        <Skeleton className="h-4 w-3/4 mt-2" /> {/* Title placeholder */}
        <Skeleton className="h-4 w-full mt-2" /> {/* Description placeholder */}
        <Skeleton className="h-4 w-1/2 mt-2" /> {/* Description placeholder */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## API

### Skeleton

The main component for creating loading placeholders.

#### Props

- `className`: string
  - Additional CSS classes to apply to the skeleton.
- All other props are passed directly to the underlying div element.

## Customization

The Skeleton component can be customized using the `className` prop. It uses Tailwind CSS classes by default, which can be overridden or extended.

## Best Practices

1. Use Skeletons to represent the layout of your page before the content has loaded.
2. Match the Skeleton's shape and size to the content it's replacing for a smoother transition.
3. Consider using multiple Skeleton components to represent complex layouts.
4. Avoid using Skeletons for very short loading times (less than 300ms) as it may create a flickering effect.
5. Ensure sufficient color contrast between the Skeleton and its background for visibility.
6. Use appropriate sizing and spacing to accurately represent the content being loaded.
7. Consider using different shapes (e.g., circles for avatars, rectangles for text) to better represent the final content.

## Examples

### Text Placeholder

```jsx
<div className="space-y-2">
  <Skeleton className="h-4 w-[250px]" />
  <Skeleton className="h-4 w-[200px]" />
</div>
```

### Card with Image and Text

```jsx
<div className="card">
  <Skeleton className="h-48 w-full rounded-t-lg" />
  <div className="p-4 space-y-2">
    <Skeleton className="h-4 w-3/4" />
    <Skeleton className="h-4 w-full" />
    <Skeleton className="h-4 w-1/2" />
  </div>
</div>
```

### Avatar and Text

```jsx
<div className="flex items-center space-x-4">
  <Skeleton className="h-12 w-12 rounded-full" />
  <div className="space-y-2">
    <Skeleton className="h-4 w-[200px]" />
    <Skeleton className="h-4 w-[150px]" />
  </div>
</div>
```

## Accessibility

While Skeletons are primarily visual elements, consider the following for accessibility:

1. Use appropriate ARIA attributes if necessary, such as `aria-busy="true"` on the parent container of the loading content.
2. Ensure that screen readers are informed about the loading state of the content.
3. Provide alternative text or descriptions for skeleton layouts when possible.
