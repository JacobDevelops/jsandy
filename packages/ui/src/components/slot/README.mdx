# Slot Component

## Overview

The Slot component is a powerful utility for component composition in React. It allows for flexible content insertion and prop merging, making it easier to create reusable and customizable components.

## Features

- Allows passing of children components with the ability to override or extend their props
- Supports merging of event handlers, styles, and classNames
- Provides a `Slottable` component for more granular control over which child components can be slotted
- Handles ref forwarding and composition

## Installation

To use the Slot component, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed in your project:

```bash
npm install @jsandy/ui
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the Slot component:

```jsx
import { Slot } from '@jsandy/ui/slot';

function Button({ children, ...props }) {
  return (
    <Slot {...props}>
      <button>{children}</button>
    </Slot>
  );
}

// Usage
function App() {
  return (
    <Button className="custom-class" onClick={() => console.log('Clicked!')}>
      Click me
    </Button>
  );
}
```

## API

### Slot

The main component for creating slottable content.

#### Props

- `children`: React.ReactNode
  - The children to be rendered within the Slot.
- All other props are passed to the slotted element.

### Slottable

A component used to wrap children that should be treated as slottable content.

#### Props

- `children`: React.ReactNode
  - The children to be treated as slottable content.

## Advanced Usage

### Using Slottable

The `Slottable` component allows for more precise control over which children can be slotted:

```jsx
import { Slot, Slottable } from '@jsandy/ui/slot';

function ComplexButton({ children, icon, ...props }) {
  return (
    <Slot {...props}>
      <button>
        {icon}
        <Slottable>{children}</Slottable>
      </button>
    </Slot>
  );
}

// Usage
function App() {
  return (
    <ComplexButton icon={<Icon />} className="custom-class">
      <span>Click me</span>
    </ComplexButton>
  );
}
```

### Merging Props

The Slot component intelligently merges props:

- Event handlers are composed (both the slot's and the child's handlers will be called).
- Styles are merged.
- ClassNames are concatenated.
- Other props from the child override those from the slot.

## Best Practices

1. Use Slot when you want to create flexible, reusable components that can be easily customized.
2. Utilize `Slottable` when you need fine-grained control over which parts of your component can be replaced or extended.
3. Be mindful of prop merging behavior, especially for event handlers and styles.
4. Use TypeScript for better type safety when working with Slot components.

## Accessibility

While the Slot component itself doesn't directly impact accessibility, it's important to ensure that the components you create using Slot follow accessibility best practices:

1. Preserve semantic HTML structure when using Slot.
2. Ensure that merged props don't override important accessibility attributes.
3. Test the resulting components with screen readers and keyboard navigation.
