# Popper Component

## Overview

The Popper component is a flexible and powerful positioning engine for React applications. It provides a way to create tooltips, popovers, dropdowns, and other floating elements that are positioned relative to a reference element.

## Features

- Flexible positioning with support for different sides and alignments
- Collision detection and avoidance
- Arrow support with automatic positioning
- Customizable offsets and padding
- Support for sticky positioning
- Hide when detached option
- Optimized or continuous position updates

## Installation

To use the Popper component, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed in your project:

```bash
npm install @floating-ui/react-dom @jsandy/ui
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the Popper component:

```jsx
import { Popper, PopperAnchor, PopperContent, PopperArrow } from './Popper';

function MyPopper() {
  return (
    <Popper>
      <PopperAnchor>
        <button>Hover me</button>
      </PopperAnchor>
      <PopperContent>
        This is the popper content
        <PopperArrow />
      </PopperContent>
    </Popper>
  );
}
```

## Components

### Popper

The root component that manages the overall state of the popper.

### PopperAnchor

Wraps the reference element that the popper will be positioned relative to.

### PopperContent

Contains the content of the popper. This is the element that will be positioned.

**Props:**

- `side`: The preferred side of the anchor to render the content against (default: 'bottom')
- `sideOffset`: The distance between the content and the anchor (default: 0)
- `align`: The preferred alignment against the anchor (default: 'center')
- `alignOffset`: The distance from the start or end of the anchor (default: 0)
- `arrowPadding`: The padding between the arrow and the edges of the content (default: 0)
- `collisionBoundary`: The element to use as the boundary for collision detection
- `collisionPadding`: The padding between the collision boundary and the content
- `sticky`: The sticky behavior on the specified axis (default: 'partial')
- `hideWhenDetached`: Whether to hide the content when it's detached from the anchor
- `avoidCollisions`: Whether to automatically adjust the content's placement to avoid collisions (default: true)

### PopperArrow

Renders an arrow pointing to the anchor.

## Customization

The Popper component is highly customizable. You can adjust its behavior and appearance through props and CSS custom properties.

## Accessibility

The Popper component is built with accessibility in mind. It uses appropriate ARIA attributes and supports keyboard navigation.
