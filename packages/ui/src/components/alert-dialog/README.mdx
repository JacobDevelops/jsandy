# AlertDialog Component

The AlertDialog component is a modal dialog that interrupts the user with important content and expects a response. It's designed for critical interactions that require immediate user attention and action.

## Features

- Interrupts the user flow, ensuring important information is not missed
- Requires a user response before it can be dismissed
- Can be used for confirmations of destructive actions, important notifications, or critical choices
- Provides a structured way to present a title, description, and action buttons
- Fully accessible, following WAI-ARIA guidelines for modal dialogs

## Installation

```bash
npm install @jsandy/ui
```

## Usage

```tsx
import {
  AlertDialog,
  AlertDialogTrigger,
  AlertDialogContent,
  AlertDialogTitle,
  AlertDialogDescription,
  AlertDialogAction,
  AlertDialogCancel,
} from '@jsandy/ui/alert-dialog';

function DeleteAccountDialog() {
  return (
    <AlertDialog>
      <AlertDialogTrigger>Delete Account</AlertDialogTrigger>
      <AlertDialogContent>
        <AlertDialogTitle>Are you absolutely sure?</AlertDialogTitle>
        <AlertDialogDescription>
          This action cannot be undone. This will permanently delete your account and remove your
          data from our servers.
        </AlertDialogDescription>
        <AlertDialogAction>Yes, delete account</AlertDialogAction>
        <AlertDialogCancel>Cancel</AlertDialogCancel>
      </AlertDialogContent>
    </AlertDialog>
  );
}
```

## Components

### AlertDialog

The root component that provides context for all other AlertDialog components.

### AlertDialogTrigger

The button that opens the dialog.

### AlertDialogContent

The container for the dialog's content.

### AlertDialogTitle

The title of the dialog. It should clearly state the purpose or main point of the dialog.

### AlertDialogDescription

Additional context or details about the dialog's purpose.

### AlertDialogAction

The primary action button in the dialog.

### AlertDialogCancel

The secondary action button, typically used to dismiss the dialog.

## Accessibility

The AlertDialog component follows WAI-ARIA guidelines for modal dialogs:

- It uses the `role="alertdialog"` to indicate that the dialog contains important information that requires the user's immediate attention.
- The dialog is modal, meaning that it's not possible to interact with other parts of the page when the dialog is open.
- Focus is automatically moved to the cancel button when the dialog opens, and is trapped within the dialog until it's closed.
- The dialog can be closed by pressing the Escape key.

## Customization

The AlertDialog components can be styled using Tailwind CSS classes. You can pass additional classes to each component to customize its appearance.

```tsx
<AlertDialogContent className="bg-red-100 border-red-500">
  {/* Dialog content */}
</AlertDialogContent>
```

## Best Practices

- Use AlertDialog for important actions that require user confirmation.
- Keep the dialog content concise and focused on a single action or decision.
- Provide clear and descriptive labels for the action buttons.
- Use the cancel button to allow users to easily dismiss the dialog without taking action.

By following these guidelines, you can create effective and user-friendly alert dialogs in your application.
