# Badge Component

The Badge component is a versatile and customizable element used for displaying short pieces of information or status indicators. It's designed to be compact, visually distinct, and suitable for various contexts within your application.

## Features

- Multiple visual variants (default, secondary, destructive, outline)
- Customizable through className prop
- Accessible focus states for keyboard navigation
- Compact design suitable for inline use
- Built with Tailwind CSS for easy styling

## Installation

```bash
npm install @jsandy/ui
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { Badge } from '@jsandy/ui/badge';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Badge>Default</Badge>
      <Badge variant="secondary">New</Badge>
      <Badge variant="destructive">Error</Badge>
      <Badge variant="outline">Custom</Badge>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Variants

- `default`: Primary color background with white text
- `secondary`: Secondary color background with appropriate text color
- `destructive`: Destructive color background (usually red) with appropriate text color
- `outline`: Transparent background with a border and text color matching the current foreground color

## Customization

### Custom Styles

You can customize the appearance of the Badge component by passing additional classes through the `className` prop:

```tsx
<Badge className="px-4 py-2 text-lg">Large Badge</Badge>
```

### Custom Variants

If you need additional variants, you can extend the `badgeVariants` function:

```tsx
import { badgeVariants } from '@jsandy/ui/badge';

const customBadgeVariants = cva(badgeVariants(), {
  variants: {
    variant: {
      ...badgeVariants.variants.variant,
      success: 'bg-green-500 text-white hover:bg-green-600',
    },
  },
});

function CustomBadge({ variant, ...props }) {
  return <div className={customBadgeVariants({ variant })} {...props} />;
}
```

## Accessibility

The Badge component includes focus styles for keyboard navigation. When using badges to convey important information, ensure that the information is also available to screen readers, either through the badge content or associated labels.

## Best Practices

- Use badges sparingly to avoid cluttering the interface
- Choose appropriate variants to match the importance or type of information
- Keep badge text concise, typically using only a few words
- Ensure sufficient color contrast between the badge and its background
- Consider using tooltips for badges that may need additional explanation

## Examples

### Status Indicators

```tsx
<Badge variant="secondary">In Progress</Badge>
<Badge variant="destructive">Failed</Badge>
<Badge variant="default">Completed</Badge>
```

### Notification Counts

```tsx
<Badge>3</Badge>
<Badge variant="secondary">10+</Badge>
```

### Feature Labels

```tsx
<Badge variant="outline">Beta</Badge>
<Badge variant="secondary">Pro</Badge>
```

By following these guidelines and examples, you can effectively use and customize the Badge component in your application to provide clear and concise visual indicators.
