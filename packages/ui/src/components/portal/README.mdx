# Portal Component

## Overview

The Portal component is a utility for rendering React children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component. It's particularly useful for creating modals, tooltips, and other floating elements that need to break out of their parent's DOM structure.

## Features

- Render children to a different part of the DOM
- Optionally specify a custom container for the portal content
- Seamless integration with React's lifecycle and events
- TypeScript support with proper type definitions

## Installation

To use the Portal component, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed in your project:

```bash
npm install @jsandy/ui
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the Portal component:

```jsx
import { Portal } from './Portal';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Component</h1>
      <Portal>
        <div>This content will be rendered outside the parent DOM tree</div>
      </Portal>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## API

### Portal

The main component for creating a portal.

#### Props

- `container?`: `Element | DocumentFragment | null`

  - An optional container where the portaled content should be appended.
  - If not provided, the content will be appended to `document.body`.

- All other props are passed directly to the root `div` element of the portal.

## Accessibility

When using the Portal component, be mindful of the following accessibility considerations:

1. Ensure that portaled content is properly associated with its trigger element using ARIA attributes when necessary (e.g., for tooltips or popovers).
2. For modal dialogs, make sure to manage focus correctly and trap focus within the modal when it's open.
3. Consider the tab order of your application when using portals, as they can affect the natural flow of focusable elements.

## Best Practices

1. Use portals sparingly and only when necessary. Overuse can lead to complex and hard-to-maintain code.
2. Always provide a fallback UI for environments where portals might not work (e.g., server-side rendering).
3. Be cautious when using portals with event bubbling, as events will bubble up through the React tree rather than the DOM tree.
4. When creating modals or overlays with portals, remember to add appropriate event listeners for closing the portal (e.g., on outside click or escape key press).

## Examples

### Modal Dialog

```jsx
function ModalExample() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>Open Modal</button>
      {isOpen && (
        <Portal>
          <div className="modal-overlay">
            <div className="modal-content">
              <h2>Modal Title</h2>
              <p>Modal content goes here.</p>
              <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(false)}>Close</button>
            </div>
          </div>
        </Portal>
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```

### Custom Container

```jsx
function CustomContainerExample() {
  const [container, setContainer] = React.useState(null);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const el = document.getElementById('custom-portal-container');
    setContainer(el);
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      <div id="custom-portal-container" />
      <Portal container={container}>
        <div>This content is rendered in the custom container</div>
      </Portal>
    </>
  );
}
```
