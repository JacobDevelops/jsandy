# Arrow Component

The Arrow component is a customizable SVG-based arrow that can be used in various UI elements such as tooltips, popovers, or custom indicators.

## Features

- Customizable width and height
- Option to replace the default arrow with custom SVG content
- Preserves aspect ratio for consistent appearance
- Fully typed with TypeScript

## Installation

```bash
npm install @jsandy/ui
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { Arrow } from '@jsandy/ui/arrow';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Arrow width={20} height={10} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

All other props are passed directly to the underlying `svg` element.

## Customization

### Custom Size

You can customize the size of the arrow by adjusting the `width` and `height` props:

```tsx
<Arrow width={30} height={15} />
```

### Custom Color

To change the color of the arrow, you can use the `fill` prop:

```tsx
<Arrow fill="red" />
```

### Custom Shape

If you need a completely custom arrow shape, you can use the `asChild` prop and provide your own SVG content:

```tsx
<Arrow asChild>
  <path d="M0,0 L10,0 L5,5 Z" />
</Arrow>
```

## Accessibility

The Arrow component is purely presentational and does not require any specific accessibility considerations. However, when using it as part of a larger component (e.g., a tooltip), ensure that the parent component meets all necessary accessibility requirements.

## Best Practices

- Use consistent sizes for arrows throughout your application to maintain visual harmony.
- When using custom SVG content, ensure it fits within the specified viewBox (0 0 30 10) for predictable results.
- Consider using the Arrow component in conjunction with other components like tooltips or dropdown menus for a cohesive design.

## Examples

### Default Arrow

```tsx
<Arrow />
```

### Customized Arrow

```tsx
<Arrow width={20} height={10} fill="blue" />
```

### Custom SVG Content

```tsx
<Arrow asChild width={20} height={10}>
  <polygon points="0,10 20,10 10,0" />
</Arrow>
```

By following these guidelines and examples, you can effectively use and customize the Arrow component in your application.
