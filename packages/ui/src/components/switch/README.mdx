# Switch Component

## Overview

The Switch component is a customizable, accessible toggle component for React applications. It provides a visual way to switch between two mutually exclusive states, typically used for enabling or disabling a feature.

## Features

- Clear visual indication of current state
- Smooth transition animation between states
- Customizable appearance through className prop
- Accessible, using appropriate ARIA attributes
- Support for keyboard interaction
- Form integration with native checkbox behavior

## Installation

To use the Switch component, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed in your project:

```bash
npm install @jsandy/ui
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the Switch component:

```jsx
import { Switch } from '@jsandy/ui/switch';

function FeatureToggle() {
  const [enabled, setEnabled] = React.useState(false);

  return <Switch checked={enabled} onCheckedChange={setEnabled} aria-label="Enable feature" />;
}
```

## API

### Switch

The main component for creating a switch toggle.

#### Props

- `checked`: boolean
  - Indicates whether the switch is checked (controlled).
- `defaultChecked`: boolean
  - The default checked state of the switch (uncontrolled).
- `onCheckedChange`: (checked: boolean) => void
  - Callback function triggered when the checked state changes.
- `disabled`: boolean
  - If true, disables the switch.
- `required`: boolean
  - If true, indicates that the switch is required in a form.
- `name`: string
  - The name of the switch when used in a form.
- `value`: string
  - The value of the switch when used in a form. Defaults to "on".
- `form`: string
  - The id of the form the switch belongs to.

All other props are passed to the underlying button element.

### SwitchThumb

A sub-component that represents the movable part of the switch. This is already included in the main Switch component and typically doesn't need to be used separately.

## Accessibility

The Switch component follows accessibility best practices:

- It uses the appropriate ARIA role ("switch").
- It manages focus and keyboard interactions.
- It integrates with forms for native form validation and events.

## Customization

The Switch component can be customized using the `className` prop. It uses Tailwind CSS classes by default, which can be overridden or extended.

## Best Practices

1. Use switches for boolean settings that can be turned on or off.
2. Provide clear labels to indicate what the switch controls.
3. Use the switch for immediate actions, where the effect is instantaneous.
4. Ensure sufficient color contrast between the switch states for visibility.
5. Use in forms or settings panels where binary choices are appropriate.
