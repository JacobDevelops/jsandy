## Overview

The Separator component is a versatile UI element designed to visually separate content in your application. It provides a simple yet effective way to create clear divisions between sections, items in a list, or any other elements that require visual separation.

## Features

- Supports both horizontal and vertical orientations
- Customizable appearance through className prop
- Accessible, using appropriate ARIA roles
- Consistent styling with other UI components
- Lightweight and easy to implement

## Installation

To use the Separator component, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed in your project:

```bash
npm install @jsandy/ui
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the Separator component:

```jsx
import { Separator } from '@jsandy/ui/separator';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Section 1</h2>
      <p>Content for section 1</p>
      <Separator />
      <h2>Section 2</h2>
      <p>Content for section 2</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## API

### Separator

The main component for creating visual separators.

#### Props

- `orientation`: "horizontal" | "vertical" (default: "horizontal")
  - Specifies the orientation of the separator.
- `decorative`: boolean (default: true)
  - When true, the separator is treated as purely decorative and removed from the accessibility tree.
- `className`: string
  - Additional CSS classes to apply to the separator.
- All other props are passed directly to the underlying div element.

## Accessibility

The Separator component is designed with accessibility in mind:

- It uses the appropriate `role="separator"` when not decorative.
- The `aria-orientation` attribute is automatically set based on the orientation prop.
- When `decorative` is true, it uses `role="none"` to remove it from the accessibility tree.

## Customization

The Separator component can be customized using the `className` prop. It uses Tailwind CSS classes by default, which can be overridden or extended.

## Best Practices

1. Use separators to improve the visual structure and readability of your content.
2. Choose the appropriate orientation based on your layout (horizontal for row layouts, vertical for column layouts).
3. Ensure sufficient contrast between the separator and its background for visibility.
4. Use separators sparingly to avoid cluttering the interface.
5. Consider using margin or padding instead for subtle separations.
6. When using vertical separators, make sure to set an appropriate height.
